The 'download.py' script can be used for quick testing, it downloads the video directly from its URL.

```
python download.py --videoList test.csv
```

The 'download_2.py' script can be used for the formal format of the CSV file, it downloads all videos for each playlist URL of podcast channels.

```
python download_2.py --videoList podcasts_list.csv
